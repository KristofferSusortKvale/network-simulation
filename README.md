# network-simulation
Simulation of packages sent through a network of nodes to check performance like node utility, queue time, later also timeouts will be implemented and the simulation will give results for timeout percentage. First version is run as seperate scripts, one per node and one per user. This will be changed into a single script run of the simulation, and after that generalized in regards to how users generate tasks for the network, how the nodes are functioning and the network structure.
